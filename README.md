# E-Bike Ratings

This project is a website that provides ratings and rankings for e-bikes and their components. The goal is to create a transparent and objective resource for e-bike enthusiasts.

## How it Works

The website uses a `ebike-data.json` file to store all the data for e-bike components, such as motors and batteries. This data is then used to dynamically generate tables and rankings on the website.

The main page (`index.html`) displays a ranking of e-bikes, while the `classifiche/componenti.html` page provides detailed rankings for individual components.

## Future Features

Here are some ideas for future features:

1.  **E-Bike Comparison Tool**: A tool that allows users to compare different e-bike models side-by-side.
2.  **User Reviews and Ratings**: Allow users to submit their own reviews and ratings for e-bikes and components.
3.  **Expanded Component Database**: Add more components to the database, such as brakes, suspension, and tires.
4.  **Dealer Locator**: A map-based tool to help users find local e-bike dealers.
5.  **Blog/News Section**: A section for articles, news, and updates about the e-bike industry.
